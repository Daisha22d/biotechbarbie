          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">ðŸ’¡ The Future of Pathology is Digital</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Pathologists have traditionally relied on glass slides and microscopes, but digital pathology is changing that. 
            AI-powered models can now analyze whole slide images (WSIs) to detect patterns, classify diseases, and assist in early diagnosis.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">ðŸ”¬ How AI is Improving Accuracy</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            By training deep learning models on thousands of annotated pathology slides, AI can help flag abnormalities, reducing human error 
            and ensuring **more precise diagnoses**. Some companies, like **PathAI** and **Tempus**, are leading the charge in AI-driven pathology.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">ðŸš€ What This Means for the Future</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            AI-assisted pathology doesnâ€™t replace human expertise but enhances it. With AI models handling repetitive tasks, 
            pathologists can focus on complex cases, leading to **faster diagnoses and better patient care**.
          </p>
  
          <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold mt-6">
            AI + digital pathology is the future of biotechâ€” and I'm here to be part of that transformation.
